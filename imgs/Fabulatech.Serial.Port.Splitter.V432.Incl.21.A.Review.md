2. Launch the program and click on the "Add new port bundle" button. A port bundle is a group of virtual COM ports that share the same physical COM port.
3. Select the physical COM port that you want to split from the drop-down list. You can also specify the baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits, and flow control for the physical port.
4. Add as many virtual COM ports as you need to the port bundle. You can assign any free COM port number to each virtual port. You can also customize the port parameters for each virtual port individually.
5. Click on the "Apply" button to save the changes and activate the port bundle. You will see a green icon next to each virtual port indicating that it is ready to use.
6. Now you can connect any communications applications to the virtual COM ports and exchange data with the serial device connected to the physical COM port. The program will split and merge the dataflow among all the applications automatically.

You can create as many port bundles as you need and manage them from the main window of the program. You can also edit, delete, or disable any port bundle at any time. You can also use the "Port monitor" feature to view the data traffic on any virtual or physical COM port in real time.
