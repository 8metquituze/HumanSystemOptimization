## David Movie Review: A Stylish but Flawed Film
 
David is a film that tries to weave together three different stories of three men named David, who live in different times and places, but are connected by a common thread of destiny. The film is ambitious in its scope and execution, but suffers from a lack of coherence and depth. The film has some brilliant moments of cinematography, music and acting, but fails to engage the viewer emotionally or intellectually.
 
The film's biggest strength is its visual appeal. The film is shot in stunning locations, such as London, Mumbai and Goa, and uses different color palettes and filters to distinguish the three segments. The film also has some impressive action sequences, especially in the London segment, where Neil Nitin Mukesh plays a ruthless gangster. The film also boasts of a diverse and eclectic soundtrack, featuring six different composers and genres, ranging from rock to folk to electronic. The film has some memorable songs, such as "Kanave Kanave" by Anirudh Ravichander and "Machi" by Remo Fernandes.
 
However, the film's biggest weakness is its script. The film tries to juggle three stories that have very little connection or relevance to each other. The film does not explore the characters or their motivations enough, and relies on clichÃ©s and stereotypes to move the plot forward. The film also suffers from uneven pacing and editing, as it jumps from one segment to another without any smooth transition or logic. The film also has some unnecessary subplots and characters, such as Lara Dutta's cameo as a politician's wife or Monica Dogra's role as a photographer. The film also fails to deliver a satisfying climax or resolution for any of the stories.
 
David is a film that has a lot of potential, but falls short of its expectations. The film is a visual treat, but lacks substance and soul. The film is worth watching for its style and music, but not for its story and message.
